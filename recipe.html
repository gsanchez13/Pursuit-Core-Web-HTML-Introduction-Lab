  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Spam musubi is a traditional Hawaiian dish, created in the 1940's during WWII by American soliders who
    were short on food.
    <br>They needed simple ingredients and in turn, used spam, rice and seaweed to create
    a now favorite delicacy found on all the islands
    <br>of Hawai'i.
